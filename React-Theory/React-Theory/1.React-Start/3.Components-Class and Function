** Class and Function and Components:-
_________________________________________
01 Class Components.
02 Create components in Individual Module.


** Class Components:-
_________________________________________
01. If we want to define any class component inside App.js or anywhere, then that class should extends Component Interface.
02. And Component interface contains one methods that is render(). render method is returnable.Compulsory we should provide the Impl 
    for render(). 
03. Once we create the class then we need to give an entry of that particular class inside pp components.
    E.g:- function App() {
          return (
    <div className="App">
      My Hello World
      <FirstComponent></FirstComponent>          -> This is the entry.
 
    </div>
  );
}	
04. App components can be class components or might be function components.
    CODE EXAMPLE:- 
	//1st PART.
	function App() {
          return (
    <div className="App">
      My Hello World
      <FirstComponent></FirstComponent>          -> This is the entry.
 
    </div>
  );
}	
    //2nd PART.
	class ThirdComponent extends Component{
                   render(){
                   return(
      <div>This is Third components:Ritesh</div>
    );
  }
}
  
  NOTE:- 1st Part is the function App component where we have to give the entry of each and every created components.
         App component will be work here just like a main method of java.
  NOTE:- 2nd Part that is fully created by developer.After creating this, compulsory we should give the entry for this inside function App or class App component.

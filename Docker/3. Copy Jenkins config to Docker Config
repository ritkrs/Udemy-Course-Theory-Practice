** Copy Artifacts On Docker:-
_________________________________________________

NOTE:- THIS WILL WORK ONLY IF YOU HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED JENKINS AND TOMCAT SERVER CONFIGURATION SEPERATELY.
       THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS, IT WILL COPY ALL THE CONFIGURATION FROM PREVIOUS CONFIGURATION.
	   SO IF THERE IS NO PREVIOUS CONFIGURATION< OBVISOULY IT WILL NOT WORK.
	   
STEP:1:-
_________________________________________________
** Go To Jenkins DashBoard->New Item->Name(Deploy_On_Docker)->Instead Of Maven select previous Job Configuration from below->Description(Deploy_On_Docker)->
   next->unselect the POLL SCM->Cross the Post Build Actions X (Remove this)->Add Post Build Actions(send build artifacts over SSH)->Here new Pop up will open->
   ssh server name[(Poc_docker)This will get automatically as drop down options from previous configuration]->source files[(webapp/target/*.war)- We can get this path by follow below command]->
   Remote Directory(.) dot or full stop]->Apply->Save.
   
   NOTE:- We can go to jenkins dashboard , and build we can here also.But it will be better if we will go for below command. 
   
   Go to jenkins Ec2 Server and go inside workspace directory and hit below commands:-
   
   find / -type d -name "workspace" - If you are not into workspace.then you can go inside workspace by using this command.
   cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace

   pwd 
   ls
   cd Deploy_On_Tomcat_3/   - 
   ls
   cd webapp/target/
   ls
   pwd
   
  After hitting the pwd command will get the one Path.(E.g:- /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Deploy_On_Tomcat_3/webapp/target)   
  Our path is, After the job name.
  
Step:-2:-
_________________________________________________
** Go to Docker Ec2 server-> 
   go to hostname(dockeradmin)->
   ls
   pwd
   go to hostname of docker - I given the name as dockeradmin.
   su - dockeradmin  -> go inside home directory or inside root of Hostname. (Here dockeradmin is hostname).
   pwd
   whoami - After hitting this command We should go inside host directory.
 
Step:3:- 
_________________________________________________
   
**  Come to Jenkins Dashboard->Build Now->   

     NOTE:- After Successfully build, It should be show just like below message.
    
	SSH: Connecting from host [jenkins]
    SSH: Connecting with configuration [POC_Docker] ...
    SSH: Disconnecting configuration [POC_Docker] ...
    SSH: Transferred 1 file(s)
    Finished: SUCCESS
	
	Pending:- This part is pending because 3 videos are not complted till now and I am also facing issue while creating connectoin.
	2. If we are starting then we can start from Very begining and from Jenkins,Tomcat then Docker.
